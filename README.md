# s-RDF2vec extension
This is the code of the forked [jRDF2vec](https://github.com/dwslab/jRDF2Vec) project.
You can run s-RDF2vec by using the `walkGenerationMode`: `EXPERIMENTAL_MID_EDGE_WALKS_DUPLICATE_FREE`

After acceptance, we will merge the changes to the original framework and document them in the user guide.
We will, furthermore, upload the vectors on our organization's server.

The evaluation was performed using the [GEval Framework](https://github.com/mariaangelapellegrino/Evaluation-Framework).
